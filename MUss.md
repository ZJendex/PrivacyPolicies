## MUss: Privacy policy

Hello! Welcome to the MUss app for Android!

This is a pure simple time management app that goal set to enraise people's mind of having a better lifestyle:)

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (like your time recording) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

I don't expect the app to connect to the internet and the app only need your permission to access the app document directory.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
ZJendex
